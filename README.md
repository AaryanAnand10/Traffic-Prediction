# Traffic-Congestion-Prediction-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This repository contains code and data for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using the Traffic Prediction dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes aggregate trip logging metrics from commercial vehicles in four major US cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia. The goal is to analyze the data and gain insights into traffic congestion based on an aggregate measure of stopping distance and waiting times at intersections.

# Objective
The main objective of this project is to:
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to summarize the main characteristics of the data.
